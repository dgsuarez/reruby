Automatic refactorings for Ruby.

## A note on safety

While we try to make Reruby as safe as possible to use, we still consider it to
be alpha. Please, commit your code before running any Reruby command.

## Rationale

Ruby is notoriously hard to refactor automatically, it's not just a dynamic
language, but one where metaprogramming is not only allowed but even
encouraged.

Reruby uses the excellent [parser](https://github.com/whitequark/parser) gem to
transform Ruby code. This means that we mostly rely on syntactic information to
perform the refactorings. Although not ideal, we've found that it works remarkably
well for the operations that Reruby provides, and while it's true that some use
cases are necessarily left out we firmly believe that a refactoring tool that
works 90% of the time is better than no tool at all.

## Installation

We are waiting for [0.1.0](https://github.com/dgsuarez/reruby/milestone/1) in
order to release on Rubygems. Meanwhile you can install by:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dgsuarez/reruby.git
cd reruby
rake install
```

## Available refactorings

Note: Some of the refactorings will produce code that is not properly indented
and that may not follow your own styleguide. Reruby can optionally run
[rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) autofix on the changed/created
files after those operations by specifying the `--rubocop-autofix` flag or
adding it to your configuration file (see below for more on this).

### Rename Const

Rename classes or modules:

`reruby rename_const 'Some::Const' 'NewConstName'`

This will:

* Update occurrences of `Some::Const` to `Some::NewConstName`
* Rename the "main" file (`lib/some/const.rb`, `app/models/some/const.rb`...)
  and the test/spec file
* Update require statements as needed

Right now it won't, but should...

* Perform the rename when part of the namespace is `included` (it won't
  recognize `A::B` in `include A; B`)
* Handle the existence of classes/modules with the same name in nested lookup
  namespaces, if you have both `B::A` and `B::C::A`, and rename `B::A`, every
  usage of both will get replaced.

### Extract method

Extract method refactoring:

`reruby extract_method -l some/path.rb:2:10:4:9 my_new_method`

This will:

* Find the code in `some/path.rb` starting on line 2, column 10 until line 4
  column 9.
* Append a new method `my_new_method` to the class where the code was defined,
  with the required arguments.
* Change the original code with an invocation to `my_new_method`, again with the
  required arguments.

Right now it won't, but should...

* Properly indent the new method definition.

### Explode Namespace

Extract classes or modules defined in the same file as their parent to a file
for each.

`reruby explode_namespace MyClass`

This will:

* Create new files (and folders if needed) for each class/module 1 level deep
  inside `MyClass` defined in the same file as `MyClass`
* Remove them from the `MyClass` file

Right now it won't, but should...

* Properly indent the outer class/module when creating new file
* Properly indent the newly added requires

### Instances to readers

Turn any instance variable read to a call to the reader method, adding the
`attr_reader` declaration as well.

`reruby instances_to_readers MyClass`

This will:

* Add `attr_reader :var1, :var2...`
* Change readings of `@var1`, `@var2` to `var1`, `var2`…

Right now it won't, but should...

* Properly indent the `attr_reader`

## Configuration

You can have per project configuration files in `.reruby.yml`, or a global one
in `~/.reruby.yml`.

Here is a sample full configuration file:

```yaml
paths:
  exclude: # Regexes for paths to ignore when looking for code to transform
    - ^vendor/
    - ^coverage/
    - ^log/
ruby_extensions: # Extensions for ruby files in your project
  - .rb
  - .rake
  - .gemspec
  - Rakefile
rubocop-autofix: true # Run rubocop -a over the files that have changed
extract_method:
  keyword_arguments: true # Use keyword arguments when using extract method
```

All options can also be specified using the command line, run `reruby --help`
for more information.

## Editor integration

Reruby reaches it's full potential when it's integrated in your text editor,
here's a list of available plugins. Please let us know which integrations you
would like to see, or if you know of an integration not available here.

* Vim [reruby.vim](https://github.com/dgsuarez/reruby.vim)

If you'd like to create a new integration, [our
guidelines](https://github.com/dgsuarez/reruby/wiki/Editor-Integration) may
help you get started.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then,
run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To run the executable while in development you can use `bundle exec exe/reruby …`.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
